                       At USAWA, our goal is to focus on integrated people-centred programs to address health and education inequities for sustainable change in South Africa.  We work alongside community leaders, academics, governance officials and other experts to strengthen systems that enable progress. Our team is largely supported by our alma mater fellowship Tekano, and the Atlantic Institute.
                       <br /><br />
                        Our launch in 2021, came at a time when the world shifted into unknown terrain. The global COVID-19 lockdown left people and communities vulnerable and further unmasked the great inequity between and within communities. Added to this, the political situation in South Africa during July 2021 led to civil unrest that saw destruction of public and private infrastructure, loss of jobs and disruption to the food supply chain.
                         <br /><br />

                        1.	PMB AID Campaign
                        We raised funds to respond to elderly communities impacted by the civil unrest and looting in 2021. Through our efforts 400 households in the KZN Midlands received non-perishable food items, adult nappies, formula milk for babies and some detergents.
                          <li class="mb-3">
                        2.	Writing circles
                        We worked with people who had little to no experience in documenting their lived experiences and community contributions to initiate a process of writing that could be shared on different platforms. We believe that documenting narratives and work done is an essential step to achieve decolonised approaches to education. Africa will always be spoken for until she begins to speak for herself. Within this space we made academic contributions through publication about youth unemployment and the SDG’s at the ARUA conference; and the need for multisectoral interventions to respond to medical brain drain in South Africa as a book chapter.

                        This project kicked off in 2021 and focused on solidarity responses for people living on farms in the Western Cape. Often a neglected sector of people, facing harsh social and economic realities, this project sought to create engagement opportunities to identify issues and seek ways to address them. The highlight of this project was the participation and engagement with children through the mentoring, peer coaching, help-me-read, and homework support programs.

                            In April 2022, some parts of KZN were significantly impacted by flooding. For outlying areas, access to support was low. We responded to 2 communities offering them psychosocial support to process the magnitude of damage and loss of life. We provided blankets and gumboots to people whose homes were damaged and belongings lost as a means to support the build-back process.

                          In the close of 2022, ahead of the high-rain season, we began a process of engagement with civil society organisations in the uMgungundlovu district in KZN to find ways to capacitate at-risk communities to build context specific community plans to respond to flooding and other threats. This is an ongoing project in 2023.

                        Good vision and eye health is central to our safety, productivity, education, mobility and health. Eye health service delivery in South Africa is disproportionately available between the public and private sectors. The increased risk for avoidable blindness is attached to multiple factors. We have narrowed our focus to the barriers to access and deliver eye health services in the public sector. The goal is to build a capable public-private partnership model that allows for sustainable service delivery access to capacitate the national department of health to achieve its priority targets within this sector.
                        For eyecare awareness month we reached 400 people offering screenings, comprehensive examinations, prescription spectacles and reading glasses.

                        This marked our first international collaboration project. We worked with Global Atlantic Fellow Rennta Chrisdiana based in Indonesia to understand how children in South Africa and Indonesia were specifically impacted by the COVID-19 lockdown and how they felt during this time. The climax of the project was a live collaboration between children from the 2 countries who narrated their lived experiences. Despite social, economic, political and geographic differences,
                        children from both countries carried grave concern for the disruption to their learning; the loss of income to their households; well being of their parents and siblings and safety. Loss of life, violence and hunger heavily impacted on children.

                       At USAWA we work with underserved communities in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.
                       <br /><br />
                      We help those who need it most.
                      Our focus is on people and communities who encounter barriers to access the social determinants of health either through limitations to access or deliver such services. While we recognise full communities in our approach, we prioritise the elderly; the orphans; children, women; people living with disability and chronic disease; people living with disabilities; undocumented people.
                       <br /><br />
                      We work with partners.
                      Our programs and projects are designed to focus on collaboration and networking. Through public-private partnerships we seek to embrace the strengths and resources of all stakeholders to achieve a common goal.
                       <br /><br />
                      We aim for sustainability.
                      Our projects are designed to transfer skills and create models that can be transferred and re-used across different communities and in broader contexts. We believe that we are catalysts for change.
